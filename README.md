# Enigma-Machine
Using Python, I created an application that uses the cryptographic technology behind enigma machine and encrypt text. The project was entirely done from scratch with minimal support. I built this project to showcase my strong problem solving and analytical skills.

# How to run the code?
Execute the main.py file with python.
Set numbers for all three rotor that prompt
Enter the sentence to be encrypted/decrypted in the prompt and press ENTER.

Note : The code will decrypt the encrypted text with same keycode(rotor numbers)
